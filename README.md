# zoom_reports
Creates a readble excel report as .xlsx file, from zoom csv.
Had a problem that School I worked at, had to make monthly reports to government, for which students attended and for how long.

In this report, it parses though each students time beeing in the meeting.

Can't remeber if this is the report that merged all student times into one or that show each time student joins and leaves as new a record.

But if you need any help setting it up feel free to contact me.
